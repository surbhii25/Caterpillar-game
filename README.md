# CATERPILLAR GAME

You must have played the caterpillar game on your cell phones when we are not introduced with smartphones. Itâ€™s a game about the hungry caterpillar that grows after every meal.

### Instructions: 
You will use the four arrow keys to move around the caterpillar to make it eat the leaf, every time it eats the leaf it will grow bigger and move around faster. You have to keep the caterpillar inside the window otherwise the game will be over. The more leaves the caterpillar eats, it will make the game difficult to play as the caterpillar will get bigger and move faster, which means you will have to play with the arrow keys faster.
